Welcome to Servant's Code!

May God continue to bless our work and your willingness to help us build the future infrastructure of the Church!

This repo contains scripts and resources to get a development environment setup on your local Windows machine. If you happen to develop on Linux or Mac, please feel free to take this work and provide a PR to this repo with the necessary tweaks!

First, ensure that you're running Windows Pro with Docker for Windows installed. If you don't have docker yet, you can find installation instructions here:
https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/

You'll also need Kubernetes running. In the Docker settings go to the Kubernetes tab, check the box next to "Enable Kubernetes" and click "Apply".

Finally, this development environment expects to run in the Linux for Windows. Configuration instructions can be found here:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10

Other prerequisites:
** Java 10 JDK
apt install openjdk-11-jdk

** Gradle
apt install gradle

** NPM
apt install npm

** Angular CLI
npm install -g @angular/cli
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.0/install.sh | bash
// Restart bash to finish installation
nvm install node
nvm use node

With Kubernetes running you can configure the Servant's Code development environment from the Linux command line by running:
./deploy-dev-env.sh

Database setup:
Populating the database. There are two database scripts that you'll need to get the database populated.
- fake-data:/src/main/db/db-setup-sql (Database creation and initial system admin creation)
- person-svc:/src/main/db/servantscode.sql (Table creation)

Connect to postgres pod: 
NOTE: This requires TTY, try windows cmd, if your local Linux prompt is not TTY enabled.
- kubectl exec -it <Your postgres pod> -- /bin/bash

Login to postgres
- psql -h localhost -U postgres
- Paste database and db user creation from fake-data
- \c servantscode servant1
- Paste table creation from person-svc
- Paste system role and user creation from fake-data
